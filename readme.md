## Context

As part of a group project, we developed an interactive "Runner" game where each user has the ability to edit their own levels.

## Features

- 5 levels of difficulty
- Leaderboard
- Options / Change of keys
- Ability to edit your levels, import your own music, background and different blocks

## Editor Menu

Level editing is done in a dedicated menu. The map is divided along its length, and the user must choose between three types of blocks (empty, low block, high block) for each fraction of the map. The user can bring their own assets to their map, meaning the background, the melody, and even the blocks images.
The editor alos provides a visualisation feature, when loading a background it will show on the blocks selection grid, and also in the previsualization section the code of the map will show.

## Leaderboard

The Leaderboard tab allows you to view the scores of different players, adding a competitive dimension to the game.

## Tech

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Bugs and not-done-yet features

- The music toggle is called 'n' times, 'n' being the number of times you enter the game. Thus, when n is an odd number the toggle ends up keeping it at the same state.
- Score isn't stopping at the death of the player
-Blocks are displayed but they're all at the bottom, when C blocks should be higher and avoided with the crouch button.
