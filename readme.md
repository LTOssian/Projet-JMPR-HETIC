# <p align="center">PARISRUNNER</p>

## Context

As part of a group project, we developped an interactive "Runner" game where each user has the ability to edit their own levels.

## Features

- 5 levels of difficulty
- Leaderboard
- Options / Change of keys
- Ability to edit your levels
- Ability to import your own music, background, and different blocks

## Editor Menu

Level editing is done in a dedicated menu. The map is divided along its length, and the user must choose between three types of blocks (empty, low block, high block) for each fraction of the map. After entering their username, the player must choose the difficulty level as well as the number of blocks available. In addition, the user can choose, via a URL, to add music to their level, as well as a background image that will scroll during the game phase.

## Leaderboard

The Leaderboard tab allows you to view the scores of different players, adding a competitive dimension to the game.

## Tech

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Bugs and not-done-yet features

- The music toggle is called 'n' times, 'n' being the number of times you enter the game
- Collisions are missing
- The runner works, but it is not connected to the rest of the site however, the version of the runner connected to the site can display the blocks of the selected level
